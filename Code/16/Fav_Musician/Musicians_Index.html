        <p>urbanation is the project of Bianca Ocampo, a twenty-year-old musician and college student making sounds from her SF Bay Area hometown. Growing up in a musically inclined family while having formal training in piano for twelve years and violin for six, urbanation’s instrumental background has only furthered her innate talent of playing by ear and creating stirring melodies. With a ”modern renaissance woman” approach -- being fully responsible for her vocals, composition, writing, recording and mastering without any help from other producers or artists -- she places importance on her music’s authenticity and truly representing the independent essence of the indie genre.

        <p>Despite only recently progressing from self-produced cover songs since 2012 to writing and recording original music, urbanation has already garnered features in curated Apple Music and Urban Outfitters playlists, articles in blogs such as VFILES and kidwithavinyl, and airtime on Australian radio station Unfolding Radio 97.1 FM, as well as California-based KDVS 90.3 FM and KSDT Radio. With all of her work created from her own bedroom, urbanation’s smooth, sentimental sound has listeners on Reddit referring to as “dream-pop.” Simple chord progressions and lo-fi synths accompany raw tales of nostalgia, coming of age revelations and classic heartbreak. Bianca released her debut EP titled easy and is currently working on her debut album, don’t ask me what it means… which she hopes to release in 2019.
